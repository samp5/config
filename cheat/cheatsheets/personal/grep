# pattern in a file
grep <pattern> <file>

# case-insensitive search (with line numbers):
grep -in <pattern> <file>

# To recursively grep for string <pattern> in <dir>:
grep -R <pattern> <dir>

# Read the search patterns from a file:
grep -f <pattern-file> <file>

# Find lines NOT containing pattern:
grep -v <pattern> <file>

# Set how many lines to show before (-B) and after (-A) pattern:
grep -B 3 -A 2 <pattern> <file>

# To grep with regular expressions:
grep "^00" <file>                                               # Match lines starting with 00
grep -E "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}" <file> # Find IP add

# To find all files that match <pattern> in <dir>
grep -rnw <dir> -e <pattern>
